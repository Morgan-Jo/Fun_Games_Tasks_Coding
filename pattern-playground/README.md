# Pattern Playground (Python)

A small, fun CLI project that generates classic ASCII patterns like pyramids, diamonds, checkerboards, and hollow boxes.

Great as a warm-up project, a mini “clean code” exercise, or a quick portfolio demo (input validation, CLI args, readable structure).

## Features
- Multiple patterns:
  - `pyramid`
  - `diamond`
  - `checkerboard`
  - `hollow_box`
- Custom size and characters
- Works via CLI flags or interactive prompts
- Clean, testable functions (easy to extend)
