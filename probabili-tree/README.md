# Probabili-Tree: The Survival Statistician

A decision-science survival game built in **R**. In this simulation, you aren't just guessing; you are analyzing real-time distribution plots to determine the safety of your next move.

## 📊 Skills Showcased
- **R Shiny:** UI/Server reactive architecture.
- **Data Visualization:** Real-time plotting with `ggplot2`.
- **Statistical Inference:** Interpreting Mean, Variance, and Outliers to assess risk.

## 🚀 Quick Start
1. Ensure you have R and the `shiny` and `ggplot2` packages installed.
2. Open `app.R` in RStudio.
3. Click **'Run App'**.
