# Terminal Quest (Python)

A fun, lightweight “choose-your-own-adventure” terminal game with:
- branching choices and multiple endings
- a simple inventory system
- random events (so each run feels different)
- save / load (JSON)

It’s intentionally small, readable, and easy to extend.

## Features
- Choice-driven story (data stored in Python dicts)
- Inventory + simple “requirements” to unlock choices
- Random encounters that can help or hurt
- Save + Load game state
