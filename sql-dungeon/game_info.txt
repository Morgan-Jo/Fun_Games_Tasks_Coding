Project: SQL Dungeon
Version: 1.0.0

STORY:
The "Root User" has corrupted the dungeon. Only a Master of Data can
re-link the fragmented tables to find the path forward.

GAMEPLAY RULES:
1. Every interaction is a SELECT, UPDATE, or DELETE.
2. Typos in SQL syntax result in damage to the player.
3. Logical errors (returning the wrong data) result in a "Missed Attack."

DEVELOPER NOTE:
This project demonstrates Python-SQLite integration and the ability
to design relational schemas that mirror real-world business logic
within a gamified context.
